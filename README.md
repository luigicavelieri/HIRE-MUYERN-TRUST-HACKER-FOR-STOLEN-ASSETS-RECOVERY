Being an artist in New York, I rely heavily on online platforms to showcase and sell my work. One day, I was approached by a gallery claiming to offer international exposure for my art. They promised to feature my pieces in exhibitions and connect me with global buyers. Excited by the opportunity, I agreed to their terms, which included an upfront payment of $3000 to cover administrative fees. I transferred the amount, hoping this would be the breakthrough I needed. However, I began to suspect something was wrong after a few weeks. The gallery’s contact person stopped responding to my emails, and when I tried to visit their address, it turned out to be fake. I realized I had fallen victim to a scam. Feeling betrayed and frustrated, I didn’t know where to turn.
